// ITCSS stands for Inverted Triangle CSS and it helps you to organize your project 
// CSS files in such way that you can better deal with (not always easy-to-deal with) 
// CSS specifics like global namespace, cascade and selectors specificity.


// Settings – used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.
@import './settings/colors';

// Tools – globally used mixins and functions. It’s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers

// Generic – reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.
@import './generic/resets';

// Elements – styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.
@import './elements/basics';

// Objects – class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for example media object known from OOCSS
@import './objects/component';

// Components – specific UI components. This is where majority of our work takes place and our UI components are often composed of Objects and Components
@import './components/event-obj';

// Utilities – utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes before in the triangle, eg. hide helper class
